## Design

### Colour Scheme

![GolfGate Website Colour Palette](documentation/color-palette.png)

The website uses a palette of vibrant and cool colours that create a sporty feel often seen used in golfing products such as driver head covers and golf balls. Its color design is robust and very easy to read allowing the user to differentiate quickly between points on the screen. The colour palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Days One is used for headings on the site. Letterforms are wide, and the strokes are thick. This makes Days One good for headlines.

* Lexend Deca is used for the body text on the site. Lexend is a collection of seven font families intended to improve reading proficiency.

### Imagery

I carefully selected golfing related images for all of the sites pages. A close up shot of a pure white golf ball shining in the sun evokes good memories for every golfer patiently waiting to get through the bad winter season. My sporty color theme and simple imagery of green grass and white coated golf ball pair well throughout the site. One image in particular lets the user imagine the ball will roll into the hole and score a point while they recieve a successful check on tee time available to book. 

### Wireframes

Early at the begining of my project i used the [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) wireframing application to help me visualise the foundation and scope of the website. I orignally intended for the company to be named GolfHub but soon scraped this idea because i thought golfgate sounded more welcoming.

## Features 

The website is comprised of 3 pages. Each page features all of the same header and footer elements for ease of use.

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - A responsive header allows users to navigate the site by using the larger the most links you see on most websites in the world today. I liked the idea of bigger font size and wrapped nicely in a cylindrical shaped border containing them. The curves co-exisit beside the sites golf ball icon. 

  - The navigational header is not stuck to the top of the page by design choice i think it allows the page to stand out more in full view when each section is scrolled upon. 

  - The websites logo and golf ball icon to the left of the header conveniently bring the user to the homepage if clicked on. This allows easy navigation for the user, making the back button redundant.

- __The landing page image__

  - I picked a dream like landing page image that was a blurred close up lens shot, this can create an aspect of excitement and an eagerness to get out and play. At the same time its subtle enough not to be a distraction to the sites interactive elements. 

  - This section is nicely split into two halves with the quick round checker highlighted in an opaque yellow on the left and the user login & register button offset to the right.

- __Inspirational quotes section__

  - The daily dose of Inspirational quotes section will be golfgates way of keeping in touch with its social side of things. This section will feature daily changes citing some of the most reknowned golfers to grace the game. Users who read it will derive a new sense of meaning of the sport.They will carry on as motivated and inspired as ever. Im sure this section will serve its purpose well.  

  - This section acts as a nice seperation from the landing page and flows well horizonatally across the page on desktop and the vertically for smaller devices.

![Daily motivational quotes](documentation/inspo-quotes.png)

- __Golf courses left available for today section__

  - This section will allow the user to see which golf courses are available only for the particular day they are currently at. This is a nice overview of what can be offered on short notice with no prior booking.
  - This section will be updated by the golfgate team and rotated and displayed in line with the demand for each club on any given day.  

![Course View section](documentation/golf-courses-view.png)

- __The News Section__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Love Running. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media

![News Section](documentation/news-section.png)

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
