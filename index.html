            <h3><u>Can the LIV tour become a staple event?</u></h3><br>
            <p>
                Padraig Harrington is one of the game's greatest European champions.<br>

                <br>He's a three-time major winner, Ryder Cup captain, and last week, claimed his first senior major at
                the
                U.S. Senior Open.<br>

                <br>Right after winning, Harrington jetted to Ireland to compete in the Irish Open, where a second-round
                71
                ensured he made the cut.<br>

                <br>After his round on Friday, Harrington was inundated with questions on the day's hot topic: DP World
                Tour
                CEO Keith Pelley's harsh response to a threat of legal action from LIV Golf participants, who are
                contesting their fines and suspensions. Currently suspended players on the PGA Tour and DP World Tour
                will be prevented from playing in next week's Scottish Open, a popular tune-up for the following week's
                Open Championship. (The DP World Tour does not have jurisdiction over the Open Championship, which is
                run by the R&A. The governing body is allowing LIV Golf participants to compete at St. Andrews this
                year.)

                <blockquote>
                    “I actually don't have any problem with the guys who have gone to LIV golf. They are gone to go and
                    do their thing,” he said.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “Everybody's got to make their own choices but you make a choice. You make your
                    bed and you sleep in it, that's it. It was very clear that the guys who didn't go, especially guys who
                    could have gone, who possibly would have had offers on the table, they have taken a big decision not
                    to take the money."
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “The guys have gone because there was an incredible amount of money on the table. No other reason,” he continued.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “It's not going to make their golf better. It's not going to do anything more that they could have done playing anywhere else. 
                    They have gone for the money, and there's great money on the table. They are professional golfers, and everybody has got to make that decision. I
                    have no problem, and those guys are going to remain my friends. I certainly have no issue with what they have
                    done."
